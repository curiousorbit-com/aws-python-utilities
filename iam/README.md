# Policy Find
A Python script that loops through all the associated IAM policies in your account
and finds a specific IAM action.

I created this after receiving lots (and lots) of emails from AWS about the 
upcoming lambda:GetFunction API requirements.

# Requirements
You need to have AWS Identity Center (AWS SSO) set up before running this script.

It requires several Python packages to run. Check the requirements.txt file
before running the script.
